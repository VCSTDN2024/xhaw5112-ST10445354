      <h3> Course Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lectures and Demonstrations: Instructors provide detailed explanations of sewing techniques, often demonstrating on a sewing machine or with specific tools. This helps students understand the theory behind sewing and see how techniques are applied in practice.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hands-on Practice: Most of the learning in sewing courses comes from hands-on practice. Students are given projects to work on, such as creating a specific garment or home décor item, which allows them to apply the techniques they've learned.</li>
          <li>Assignments and Projects: Students are often assigned projects that progressively increase in difficulty. These assignments are designed to build confidence and competence in sewing. For instance, a beginner might start with a simple bag, progressing to more complex items like a dress or a tailored jacket in advanced courses.</li>
          <li>eedback and Critiques: Instructors typically provide feedback on students' work, pointing out areas for improvement and offering tips to refine their technique. This personalized guidance is crucial for developing sewing skills.</li>
          <li>Assessments: Some courses, particularly those offered by institutions or as part of a certification program, include assessments. These could be in the form of practical exams, where students must demonstrate their ability to sew a particular item, or written tests covering sewing theory and techniques.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
         
        <h3>Tools and Materials</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Fabrics: Different projects require different types of fabrics. Courses will teach students how to select appropriate fabrics based on the project and the characteristics of the material (e.g., weight, stretch, drape).</li>
            <li>Notions: This includes all the small items used in sewing, such as threads, needles, zippers, buttons, and trims. Courses often cover the selection and use of these materials.</li>
            <li>Pattern Making Tools: For courses that involve garment construction, pattern making tools like rulers, pattern paper, and measuring tapes are essential. Students learn how to read, modify, and create patterns.</li>
            <li>Cutting Tools: Sharp scissors, rotary cutters, and cutting mats are basic tools needed for cutting fabric accurately.</li>
            <li>Pressing Equipment: An iron and ironing board are necessary for pressing seams and ensuring a professional finish.</li>
          </ul>
