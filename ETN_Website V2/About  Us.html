            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                At Empowering the Nation, we strive to uplift local workers by providing training that enhances their skillsets, making them more marketable and capable. 
                Founded in 2016, we aim to empower domestic workers and gardeners through education, offering life-changing opportunities for personal and professional growth.

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Empowering the Nation began with a simple mission: to uplift and empower local workers by providing them with valuable, marketable skills. From our humble beginnings, 
                we recognized the untapped potential within communities, particularly among domestic workers and gardeners who often lack access to professional development opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, we have expanded our offerings to include essential life skills, first aid, sewing, landscaping, and more. Each course equips participants 
                with real-world expertise, improving employability while boosting confidence and independence. Today, we continue to grow, helping thousands of workers secure brighter futures.

                Our company started in 2018 with just 6 applicants from a small office in Benoni. Since then, we have expanded significantly and helped over 3,000 individuals improve their lives 
                through our comprehensive training programs. We are passionate about social change and committed to supporting communities by providing education and skill development.
